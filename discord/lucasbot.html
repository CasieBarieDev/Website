		<p>Some time ago, my friend approached me with a request to assist him with a research project he was undertaking for school. After discussing various ideas, we decided to collaborate on developing a straightforward yet functional Discord bot.</p><br>
		<p class="gray">This bot, though simple, incorporated a few entertaining and interactive features. When my friend presented this project to his class, it was very well received, and he ended up earning an excellent grade for his efforts!</p>
