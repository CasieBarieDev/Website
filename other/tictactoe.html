		<p>A beginner-friendly implementation of the classic two-player game, Tic-Tac-Toe. Developed as my very first Python project, this simple game allows players to enjoy a straightforward and nostalgic experience directly in the console.</p><br>
		<p class="gray">This project serves as a great introduction to Python programming, showcasing fundamental concepts like loops, conditionals, and basic input/output operations. It's also a fun way to practice problem-solving and game logic development.</p><br>
		<p class="gray">Please note, as this is an older project, it may have some bugs or limitations. Despite this, it remains a charming example of early coding efforts.</p><br>
