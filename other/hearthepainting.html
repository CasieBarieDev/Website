		<p>For my study, I explored the idea of describing a painting using senses other than sight, focusing specifically on sound.</p><br>
		<p class="gray">I envisioned a scenario where blind individuals visiting a museum could touch a painting while hearing sounds that bring the artwork to life. To illustrate this concept, I created a small webpage as a proof of concept.</p><br>
		<p class="gray">Note: The webpage is in Dutch and is not optimized for small screens.</p>
